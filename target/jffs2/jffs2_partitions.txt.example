# This is a sample file for setup of JFFS2 partitions, please note that you
# _must_ have a "root" mount name. The script will allway assume to find a
# root partition.
#
# The system as of today only support one partition in a sub directory. Which
# means you can not have a partition for /var and another for /var/lib. Feel
# free to modify the make-part-images.sh script (-:
#
# Each mount name _must_ be unique.
