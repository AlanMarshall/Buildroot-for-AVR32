	  ID3 tag library support for libmad, a high-quality MPEG audio
	  decoder. It currently supports MPEG-1 and the MPEG-2 extension to
	  lower sampling frequencies, as well as the de facto MPEG 2.5 format.
	  All three audio layers — Layer I, Layer II, and Layer III (i.e. MP3)
	  — are fully implemented.
